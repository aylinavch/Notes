# Notes

This repository was created in order to recopilate information about Signal Processing applied to Biomedical Signals. 

1. `Signals.ipynb`: Basic theory about System, Signals and Digital Filters
2. `PSDs.ipynb`: About Signal Energy and different ways to calculate Power Spectral Density of signals
3. `POO[ES].md`: Theory about Object Oriented Programming (in spanish, not finished yet)
4. `OOP.ipynb`: About Object Oriented Programming with Python examples (in english)

## Other resources from Aylin :D
I've been putting down some tips I've found on internet and everywhere about different programming stuff on my [Notion webpage](https://gorgeous-sky-34f.notion.site/PROGRAMMING-eb8c1fa0401f4013955a1f36a8cb48dd?pvs=4). This information is in Spanish and it is not super-complete. These are notes for myself that could help others ðŸ˜„
